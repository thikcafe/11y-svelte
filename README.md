# NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED - CHECK OUT [TEA STACK](https://github.com/mattwaler/tea-stack) INSTEAD

This repo was created a while ago, before Alpine existed and Svelte was the simplest reactive frontend framework.

However, Alpine is a much better fit for Eleventy projects. Being able to sprinkle reactivity into your templates is much better than having to instantiate Svelte instances in your templates. Also, by using Alpine, all your content is statically generated and indexable, whereas Svelte will need to render on the client side. 

I created a new project, the [tea stack](https://github.com/mattwaler/tea-stack) (Tailwind, Eleventy, and Alpine), which I believe is a much better project overall.

I will not be updating this project going forward. Thanks for checking this out, and be sure to check out the other repo as well!
